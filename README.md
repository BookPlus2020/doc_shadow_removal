# doc_shadow_removal
This work aims to remove the shadows exiting in documents, and generate a clear and easy-to-read document. 

If you try to use this code, please cite our paper 
"An Effective Background Estimation Method For Shadows Removal Of Document Images"  which has been accepted by ICIP2019.


The test dataset comes from http://cvc.ucsb.edu/graphics/Papers/ACCV2016_DocShadow/.

Thanks the work from Derek Bradley, and the implementation https://github.com/phryniszak/AdaptiveIntegralThresholding.  

We really thank Steve Bako (University of Berkeley, Santa Barbara), V. Shah (IIIT Hyderabad),  Xiaoming Yu (Peking University) for interesting discussions and their code sharing.
